                    I'm an 18 year old currently enrolled in UPenn's fullstack web development course. Currently, I'm a manager at a local ice cream shop and have been working 
                    there since I was 15.

                    As of right now, I have two major hobbies that are weightlifting and video games. I got into weightlifting because how fragile I used to be.
                     From my time lifting I have put on 35 pounds and got a lot stronger. Video games have been a big part of life since I was 6 getting my first gaming console, Playstation 2.
                     From that point I have been playing different types of video games. My current favorite game is called Rocket League. On that game I have 1300 logged hours and currently top 0.5%
                     on the ranked leaderboards.
